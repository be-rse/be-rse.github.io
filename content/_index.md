# Welcome to the BE-RSE community

The big promise of software is to make the impossible possible and to make our lives easier - to automate the tedious and the error prone. Modern scientific research relies on these properties of software and on the talent, skill, and dedication of software developers. But all too often, research software and its developers are hidden behind the science they make possible.

The aim of the Belgium Research Software Engineers community is to **foster a community of research software developers** and to collectively **improve the standard of software** used for scientific research.
